Unndís is a particularly lively, people-loving female who greets every day with curiosity and joy. She loves people – truly everyone – and is convinced that each person is her new best friend. Her social, open character ensures she is welcomed warmly everywhere.

At the same time, she is very independent and creative – no fence is safe from her, and where other dogs fail, she will find a way. She is a master at taking care of herself when the opportunity arises – whether by her keen sense for food sources or her charming persuasion skills with new acquaintances. Despite (or perhaps because of) her independence, she remains loyal to her family and constantly seeks human connection.

A true Icelandic Sheepdog – robust, clever, and full of character.
