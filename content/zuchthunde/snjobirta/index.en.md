We renamed Snjó-Birta to Birna because of the nicer sound. She is a dreamy, very people-oriented female who has a charming mind of her own. She loves company – not only from her family, but also from everyone she meets at campsites. With a fine sense for interesting people, she often chooses by herself which neighboring family she wants to spend the evening with. Her friendly, open nature makes her beloved everywhere.

Despite her gentle and calm demeanor, she is alert and has a good sense of situations. Her remarkable balance and sociability make her a wonderful companion both in everyday life and in nature.
