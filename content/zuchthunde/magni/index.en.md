Magni is a bold and curious male who explores his surroundings with great attentiveness. When hiking, he loves to sniff around extensively and take his time with every detail along the trail. He feels especially at home in the mountains – where he shows his special talent as an exceptionally good climber. On our tours through the rugged rocks of Corsica, he impressively demonstrated how sure-footed and brave he is.

Typical of his friendly nature is also his loving relationship with our horses – he loves to gently lick their noses.
