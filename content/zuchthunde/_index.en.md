Our dogs are more than just breeding animals – they are family members, companions, soul-comforters, and friends. Here, we introduce our girls and boys, each with their own unique and lovable traits.

All of our dogs receive regular veterinary check-ups. Health, character, and species-appropriate care are our top priorities.
