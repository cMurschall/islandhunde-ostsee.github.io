We are a small, family-run Icelandic Sheepdog kennel located on the picturesque Baltic Sea coast. Our dogs live with us as full family members on our Icelandic horse farm Kjölavík – together with horses, cats, and a steady stream of visitors including children of all ages, surrounded by nature, open space, and sea breeze.

🐾 **Icelandic Sheepdogs** are cheerful, intelligent, and sensitive companions with a unique personality. Our breeding follows the strict guidelines of DCNH and FCI – with a strong focus on health, character, and social compatibility.
