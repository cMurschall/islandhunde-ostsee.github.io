### Our First Litter Has Arrived!
On September 15, 2025, our [Birna](/zuchthunde/snjobirta/) gave birth to six healthy puppies – **five males and one female**. All puppies have the breed-typical **double dewclaws** of the Icelandic Sheepdog.

Mother and pups are doing well. The little ones are thriving and spending their first days peacefully in the whelping box. Birna is taking care of her lively bunch with calmness and devotion.

This is the **most exciting litter of 2025**, as both parents are **imports**:
- Father: [Magni](/zuchthunde/magni/)
- Mother: [Birna](/zuchthunde/snjobirta/)

We are overjoyed with the new arrivals and look forward to seeing how the puppies develop over the coming weeks.
